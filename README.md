Trivia-Game

The project demonstrates use of JS timeintervals/timeouts through timed trivia game questions.

Users can launch the index.html file to interact with the gave preface and once generalized can go use the .js file to see how the code interfaces with the questions.

Please feel free to leave a comment or contact me through github dm's, any feedback is welcomed.

The repository and code in it are maintained by Priyesh Patel
